    <h3>Learning Journey</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>This is my very first portfolio project. I am excited to share my progress and practice my HTML skills.</p>
    <p>Here, you will find my work, reflections, and learning experiences as I grow as a developer.</p>
    <p>Each section of this site represents a step in my coding journey, with experiments and small projects.</p>
    <p>I hope this portfolio inspires others to start their own journey in technology.</p>
